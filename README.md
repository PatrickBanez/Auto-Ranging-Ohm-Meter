# Auto-Ranging-Ohm-Meter
Created by: Patrick Banez and Gabe Hearon

An Arduino based auto-ranging ohm meter with a custom designed printed circuit board. This project was created for the University of Washington's course B EE 425 Microprocessor System Design.

The range of resistor measurements that the Arduino is capable of reading is from 1 ohm to 1 Mohm. We were able to read down to 0.1 ohm with a 1.11% accuracy. A project write up is provided that details decision choices, design, BOM, tests, and results.
